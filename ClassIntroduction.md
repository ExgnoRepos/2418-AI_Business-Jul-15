# Logistics

- The class runs from 10am to 5pm from July 15 to July 16
- Lunch is from 1 to 2pm without fail. This gives you a predictable block of time to manage out of class issues like returning calls and scheduling meetings.
- There is a 15min break mid-morning-ish and another mid-afternoon-ish. The actual time will depend on where we are in the flow of the material.

## Class Protocols

The measure of how effective this class is how much you learn as opposed to the amount of material thrown at you during these four days.

In keeping with that, my classes are run under the following protocols.

- __Questions are ALWAYS appropriate.__ Ask questions when they occur to you and are fresh in your mind. Normally, I notice when someone raises their hand, but I don't seem to have notices, then do unmute yourself and get my attention.
- At various points during the class, I will run through the participant list and check to see how you are coming along with the material. This is my measure of how well we are doing as a class, so if you feel lost or confused, this is when you tell me. Almost always, if you are confused, it's because I didn't explain something well enough.
- If you know in advance that if you are going to be late or away for part of the class, let me know in advance, so I don't hold the class up waiting.
- __Have Fun!!!__
